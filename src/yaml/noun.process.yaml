  definition:
  - a thermodynamic process during which the volume of the closed system undergoing
    such a process remains constant.
  example:
  - In practice, a gas that receives heat in an isochoric process is a constant volume
    heating and at the same time it is a constant volume pressurization; a gas that
    looses heat in an isochoric process is a constant volume cooling and at the same
    time it is a constant volume depressurization.

  definition:
  - the spread of cultural items — such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies,
    languages etc. — between individuals, whether within a single culture or from
    one culture to another.
  example:
  - The case of cultural diffusion, in contrast, makes it tempting to suggest that
    there might be many independent terms contributing to the spatial dispersion of
    a cultural trait.

  definition:
  - An expansion or compression of a gas in which the quantity pV n is held constant,
    where p and V are the pressure and volume of the gas, and n is some constant.
  example:
  - The process taking place during hydrogen's compression from the 30 bar lower limit
    to the 200 bar upper limit is a polytropic process.
