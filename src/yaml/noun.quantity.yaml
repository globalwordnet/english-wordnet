  - (computer science) a bit that is used in an error detection procedure in which
    a 0 or 1 is added to each group of bits so that it will have either an odd number
    of 1's or an even number of 1's; e.g., if the parity is odd then any group of
    bits that arrives with an even number of 1's must contain an error
