    the LCMS that ordination is a mere adiaphoron, that â€˜laying on of handsâ€™ does
    not mean ritual ordination but rather a democratic election, that ordination confers
    nothing - I have yet to ever read about anyone actually graduating seminary and
    taking a call to a congregation and choosing to forgo the rite of ordination.
